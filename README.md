A customized ScrollView like the check-in page of 流利说

###What is it
When I first saw the check-in page of 流利说, I was attracted by the weird scrollview. It seems that the scrolling can be paused. After searching for a while, I found a solution using a customized scrollview which is a subclass of `UIView`. And this project is that demo. Details about the custom scrollview can be found [here!](http://holko.pl/2014/07/06/inertia-bouncing-rubber-banding-uikit-dynamics/).
